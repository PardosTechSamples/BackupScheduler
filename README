BackupScheduler 1.0



This Batch Script is designed to automatically compress and backup 1 to 2 Servers.
Once complete, a log is saved to location C:\BackupScheduler\logs\ and a 7 day rotating backup is saved on the local Drive @ C:\BackupScheduler\BACKUPS\. Combined with Task Scheduler, this tool can prove useful for automating regular backups of drives on windows machines.

This script requires 7zip File manager to compress its files.



Note: 

In order to increase pritority of script in Task Scheduler:
  Setup the script to run at your desired schedule. Then, export to XML.
  Once you have exported your XML, change the <Priority> Level to 3 and reimport into Task Scheduler.
